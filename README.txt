Justify why your project is worth 100 points.  For example: What was hard?
    -Collision Detection: Accurately detecting collisions as fish grow in size. We ran into problems with incorrect calculations but much troubleshooting got us to the finish line.
    -Image Flipping: making the fish face the direction that they are swimming in was a headache
    -Dynamic movement: making the fish swim in all directions instead of just on one axis/plane
Did you use any cool JavaScript libraries?
    -no because we wanted to approach the inspirational polkadot game raw.
What nifty features of your program were a bear to implement?
    -making the images of the fish flip after they hit the walls was pretty cool to make the game look more realistic. 
What did you learn?
    -this was actually such a fun little project that I will be throwing it onto my portfolio along with my go webstore.
